# Cat Blog

In this workshop I created a cat blog page to apply my learning of semantic html elements such as: `main`, `nav`, `article` and `footer` elements.

## Objective

The goal of this workshop was to get hands-on practice with using semantic html elements and how to properly structure a simple blog.

## Notes

- I learned and applied the `address` element
- I learned to link phone number and email directly
- I used placeholder text from the lorem ipsum site
