# Hotel Feedback Form

I built this project to learn different input types. It's a simple form that collects user info by using different inputs and attributes.

# Objective

This workshop was to help me learn and enforce html forms and input types.

# Notes

- I learned to group different form sections using `fieldset` element.
- I used different input types
- I learned to give appropriate attributes to `label`, `form`, and `input` elements.
- I learned the `select` element.
